The difference between: 
   1. Supervised Machine Learning:
      
          Data: Labeled
                (input, desired output)
          Problems:
                Classification
                Regression
                Recognition 
                Diagnosis 
           Neural Network Models:
                Perceptron
                Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron)
                Feed-forward Neural Networks (including Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP)
                Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks
  
   3. Unsupervised Machine Learning:
      
           Data: Unlabeled
                 (Different realizations of input)
           Problems:
                Clustering
                Content-Addressable Memory 
           Neural Network Models:
                Hopfield Networks (used for associative memory, but can also be seen as energy-based models)
                Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
